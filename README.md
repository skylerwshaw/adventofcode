This repo is documenting my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2021 solutions in Elixir and maintained in a [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/).

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed

```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
